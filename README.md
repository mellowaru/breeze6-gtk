# breeze6
A work in progress gtk adaptation of the Breeze Qt style. Aiming for better accuracy than the existing breeze gtk theme.

The theme was originly based on adw-gtk3 however i have completly restarted from scratch cuz its ***fun***. <br>
im writing this directly into one file, no scss, because i personaly see it as a fun challenge, and im doing this entirly because its fun for me.

This is purly a "for fun when im bored" project, and it is never guaranteed to work, or be finished, as its only being tested on my device, and for my usecases.

If you do decide to use it you are expected to:
1. Know how gtk themes work.
2. Fix any issue yourself.
