# breeze6
A work in progress gtk adaptation of the Breeze Qt style. Aiming for better accuracy than the existing breeze gtk theme.

The theme was originly based on adw-gtk3 however i have completly restarted from scratch cuz its ***fun***.
im writing this directly into one file, no scss, because i personaly see it as a fun challenge, and im doing this entirly because its fun for me.

This is purly a "for fun when im bored" project, and it is never guaranteed to work, or be finished, as its only being tested on my device, and for my usecases.

# ${{\color{#ff4043}\textbf{THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS, IN MANY PARTS IT WILL NOT BE FINISHED!}}}\$
