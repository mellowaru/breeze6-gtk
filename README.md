# breeze6
A work in progress gtk adaptation of the Breeze Qt style. Aiming for better accuracy than the existing breeze gtk theme.

The theme is based on [adw-gtk3](https://github.com/lassekongo83/adw-gtk3) <br>
Im writing this from the actual finished `css` file, not source `scss` of adw-gtk3 because i personaly see it as a fun challenge, and im doing this entirly because its fun for me.

This is purly a "for fun when im bored" project, and it is never guaranteed to work, as its only being tested on my device for my usecases.

# ${{\color{#ff4043}\textbf{THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS, IN MANY PARTS IT WILL NOT BE FINISHED!}}}\$
