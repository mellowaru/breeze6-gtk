# BBbreeze GTK
A new GTK theme to mimic the Breeze Qt style used by KDE.

**Why?** <br>
The default Breeze GTK theme is kinda bad imo. <br>
This is still very much a for-fun-first project, and will only be worked on when there is a need for me to do so.

## Completion
- [ ] GTK3 Theme.
- [ ] GTK4 Theme. (unclear if this will be made)
GTK3 is pretty much done and usable. GTK4 is completly broken still, will be worked on.

## Installation
### Dependencies
- Dart Sass (pre v3.0.0)

### Installation
